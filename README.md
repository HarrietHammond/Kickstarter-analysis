Deliverable 3: Analysis of Theater Outcome Based on Launch Date and Play Outcomes vs Goals
Analysis of the Kickstarter event showed various trends. We will look at two Parent Categories (theater and play) and how they fared based on outcome and goals.
Theater Outcome Based on Launch Date
Generally, the Theater event was successful all year round as compared to its failed outcomes. The Summer months starting from May, June and July experienced the most success and overall total outcomes. The total (successful and failed) outcomes for these months were 166, 153 and 138 counts respectively. The successful outcomes steadily slowed until September then slightly picked up in October. The month of May recorded the most (peak) successful outcomes of 111 count. The successful count was twice the failed outcomes count (52) for the same month. Month of December had very similar outcomes for both successful (37) and failed (35). Both February and April experienced very similar total counts of 113 each. Both months had identical successful counts and a very close failed outcome. Launch date in October showed a higher failed count outcome compared to the total count. A launch date in the summer months of May, June and July was the most successful with the best outcome.

Play Outcomes vs Goals
Play outcomes versus goals showed an overall increased successful percent rate when the goal was less the 4999. The successful outcome declines as the goal increased. The outcome recorded the most failed percent (88%) when the goal was 50000 of more. The percentage successful was at its lowest (13%) at that same goal. A lower goal of less than 4999 yielded the most combined successful outcome.
